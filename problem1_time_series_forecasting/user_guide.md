## 1. Project Requirements Audit

The following is a summary of the project goals and deliverables derived from your input:

### Project Title
**Time Series Revenue Forecasting for Sport Gear Store**

### Project Description
The project involves predicting the next 10 weeks of revenue for a sport gear store using time series analysis. The data provided is in an Excel file with a 'week' column that needs to be converted into a datetime format. The analysis should account for both seasonality and trend in the data.

### Key Goals
* Accurately predict the next 10 weeks of revenue
* Ensure the model accounts for both seasonality and trend
* Generate a datetime column from the 'week' column in the provided Excel data

### Deliverables
* A runnable code script in R or Python that generates the forecast when executed
* A comprehensive white paper explaining model selection, criteria, and parameter choices
* A forecast of revenue for the next 10 weeks with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%

## 2. Instructions for Use

The generated output is in the `./integrated_output/scripts` directory.

The following files were generated for the **python** tech stack:
* `source_data_preprocessing_85201d84.py`
* `data_preprocessing_blueprint_42cc6145.txt`
* `data_preprocessing_script_3646fb45.py`
* `model_selection_report_af84fa5b.txt`
* `forecasting_model_blueprint_b7847640.txt`
* `forecasting_model_implementation_94f8bef4.py`
* `results_visualization_blueprint_1081b95a.txt`
* `results_visualization_script_5302156e.py`
* `llm_api_configuration_check_b225f230.txt`
* `main.py`
* `main_file_name`
* `scripts_dir`

### Setup and Execution
1.  **Navigate** to the output scripts folder: `cd integrated_output/scripts`
2.  **Ensure** all necessary LLM API keys are set as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3.  **Run** the main file from your terminal. The LLM has identified the main entry point as **`main.py`**.

This will run the full end-to-end workflow and print the final response to your terminal.
